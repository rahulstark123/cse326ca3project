        Revolution &nbsp; of &nbsp; Grocery &nbsp; Shop
     </div> 
     <div class="material">
       The grocery business is changing and it’s changing fast. You can call it a revolution, 
       another victim in the retail apocalypse, the latest sector to be disrupted by tech or
        yet another industry being “killed” by millennials. One thing is for certain: a grocery
         revolution began in earnest in 2017, and it’s far from over. An industry that was the stable,
          boring bedrock of the consumer market for decades came under pressure from all directions
           this past year. The moats which had protected this reliable business were drained by new
            technologies, growing consumer revolt from our current unsustainable food system,
             and a looming logistics revolution on the horizon.
     
   </br></br></br></br>
   Food had always been local, and this new system changed that. It centralized vendor 
   purchasing and in the process eliminated a lot of the transparency. Food is a basic 
   human need. It is virtually recession proof, with thin margins offset by scale.
    Consumers are loyal to their brands, and relatively consistent in their buying 
    habits. Much (but not enough) of the food we eat is perishable and requires 
    semi-regular restocking trips. It makes for a dull, but steady business, with 
    a few large multinationals controlling most of the market.
   </br></br></br></br>
   
   There was a revolution in the grocery business in 2017, and it’s far from over. 
   The industry will further resemble a dumbbell, with the lowest cost, most 
   convenient providers on one end, and the most talented curators of products
    and experiences on the other and not much left in the middle. Remember A&P? 
    They filed for Chapter 11 in 2015. Just as the rise of the grocers made the
     current food system possible at the turn of the 20th century, all these
      influences in the beginning of the 21st century are going to create a new
       food system. There will be more of what worked, enabled by technology to
        increase scale, efficiency, and logistics, as well as an opportunity for
         something new, healthier, and more sustainable. The outcome will be 
         determined by those companies responsive enough to listen and adjust to 
         the changing tastes and demands of consumers.
